## Headers in Route Handlers

- HTTP headers represent the metadata associated with an API request and response

### Request Headers

- These are sent by the client, such as web browser, to the server. They contain essential information about the request, which helps the server understand and process it correctly.
- `User-Agent` which identifies the browser and operating system to the server.
- `Accept` which indicated the content types like text, video, or image formats that the client can process
- `Authorization` header used by the client to authenticate itself to the server.

### Response Headers

- These are sent back from the server to the client. They provide information about the server and the data being sent in the response.
- `Content-Type` header which indicated the media type of the response. It tells the client what the data type of the returned content is, such as `text/html` for HTML documents, `application/json` for data, etc.
